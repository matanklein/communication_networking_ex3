/*
* @brief A checksum function that returns 16 bit checksum for data.
* @param data The data to do the checksum for.
* @param bytes The length of the data in bytes.
* @return The checksum itself as 16 bit unsigned number.
* @note This function is taken from RFC1071, can be found here:
* @note https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1071
* @note It is the simplest way to calculate a checksum and is not very strong.
* However, it is good enough for this assignment.
* @note You are free to use any other checksum function as well.
* You can also use this function as such without any change.
